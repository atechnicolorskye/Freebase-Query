# Freebase-Query
Various scripts to replicate the code used to query Freebase in Large-scale Semantic Parsing via Schema Matching and Lexicon Extension

The code in this script serves to obtain relevant Freebase relations as done in Large-scale Semantic Parsing via Schema Matching and Lexicon Extension and automatically construct lambda forms of the questions provided in the dataset of the above paper. The lambda forms of the questions might not necessarily be exact to their counterparts in the dataset so they might need some minor additions/subtractions.
